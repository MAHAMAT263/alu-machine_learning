#Classification Repository Overview

Introduction
Welcome to the Classification Repository! This resource is designed to help you gain a foundational understanding of classification tasks in machine learning.

What is Classification?
Classification is a machine learning task focused on predicting the category or class of a data point based on its features. It falls under supervised learning, where the algorithm is trained on labeled data to learn patterns.

How Does Classification Work?
Classification involves training an algorithm to map input features to categorical labels by analyzing labeled training data. Once trained, the model can assign new data points to predefined categories.

Key Concepts in Classification
Here are some important terms in classification:

Classes: The categories or labels the algorithm predicts.
Features: The input variables or attributes used for predictions.
Decision Boundaries: The divisions in the feature space that separate classes.
Class Probabilities: The likelihood of each class given the input features.
Confusion Matrix: A table that measures the performance of a classification model.
Types of Classification Algorithms
There are several classification algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Naive Bayes
Neural Networks
